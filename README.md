Problem 1: Book and Library

Write a class named Book that has the following fields:
author. The author field is a String object that holds the author’s name.
title. The title is a String object that holds the book’s title.
pages. The pages field is an int variable that holds the number of pages of the book.
publisher. The publisher field is a String object that holds the publisher’s title.
phone. The phone field holds the publisher’s phone number. What data type will you use for this field? Why?
Write a method called createBook() that takes as an input a book author, title, pages, publisher, and phone number and populates all the instance fields.
 
Write another method that prints the information of the book in a readable format of your choice.
 
 
Once you have written the Book class, write a separate class called Library that creates three Book objects to hold the following data:
 
Author: Susan Meyers
Title: Book1
Pages: 200
Publisher: Publisher1
Phone number: 9195550110
___________________________________
Author: Mark Jones
Title: Book2
Pages: 120
Publisher: Publisher2
Phone number: 9195550169
___________________________________
Author: Joy Rogers
Title: Book3
Pages: 325
Publisher: Publisher3
Phone number: 9195550114

The program should store this data in the three objects, then display the data for each book on the screen.
